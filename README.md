# mealcycle

Small streamlit app to cycle through a list of meals you can make

## Problem description

You know how you cook (somewhat). You don't know what to cook, 
though, and you end up making the same thing over and over again.
Some things you only cook very occasionally, because you forget about
it. This app solves that problem.
